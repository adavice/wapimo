                    Your privacy is important to us. Where the processing is based on consent and to the extent
                    permitted by law, by agreeing to these Terms, you consent to https://wapimo.com collection, use, and
                    disclosure of Your Content and Data. wapimo.com (we, us or ours) are the controller of your personal
                    information, and we are obligated to protect and respect your privacy and your personal integrity
                    when you use our products and services and are browsing the website.<br>
                    This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect, how we use and share
                    that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into
                    and forms part of our Terms & Conditions.<br>
                    Before using the Service or submitting any Personal Data to the Company, please review this Privacy
                    Policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By using the Service, you agree to the
                    practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do
                    not access the site or otherwise use the Service.
                </p>

                <h4>PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</h4>
                <p>Personal data is all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person
                    (hereinafter referred to as person concerned); a natural person is deemed to be identifiable if they
                    can directly or indirectly be identified in particular by means of allocation to identification such
                    as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identification or one or more specific
                    features that are an expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic,
                    cultural or social identity of this natural person.<br>

                    You can in principle view our websites without entering any personal data. As a rule, we only store
                    the website from which you accessed our website, the name of your internet service provider, which
                    websites you visited within our website, and the date and duration of your visit. In order to do
                    this, small files (known as cookies) are stored in your computerâ€™s memory for the duration of your
                    visit. These are what are known as temporary session cookies. The session cookies are automatically
                    deleted as soon as you close your browser window. We use the session cookies to create what is known
                    as a session ID for internal statistical purposes.<br>

                    The data obtained are fully anonymized, so there is no chance of you being identified as a person.
                    Your IP address and a time stamp are stored for security reasons and only used for internal
                    purposes. The IP address is a machine-related identification that enables a conclusion to be drawn
                    about the computer used to access the internet or the internet gateway used at the time of the
                    online inquiry. The term time stamp means a value in a defined format that allocates a time to an
                    event (such as the sending or receiving of a message or the modification of data or the like). The
                    purpose of a time stamp is to make clear to people or computers when events occurred.<br>

                    We obtain your personal data when you enter these data in a registration or contact form on our
                    website, thereby registering for value-added services/information and multimedia services.
                </p>

                <p>If you have granted consent for advertising when you registered, we will also store your registration
                    data (date and time of declaration of consent, IP address, your browser and operating system
                    details, device).<br>
                    Once you are registering for the value-added services/information and multimedia services, we may
                    ask you further questions that you can answer (but do not have to answer). These questions ask about
                    general preferences and interests (e.g. industry). If you answer these questions, we will also store
                    these answers so we and our sponsors can send you advertisements appropriate to your interests. The
                    data are, however, only stored and passed on to the sponsors if you have granted consent for
                    advertising.
                </p>

                <h4>HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                <p>We primarily use and collect your personal data to run the value-added services/information and
                    multimedia services.<br>

                    However, some of your data are also collected for advertising purposes. If you participate in the
                    value-added services/information and multimedia services (which are funded by advertising) via the
                    online form and grant consent for advertising at the same time, the subject matter of the
                    value-added services/information and multimedia contract concluded also includes the transfer of
                    data for promotional purposes. In this case, your contractual consideration is that you grant
                    consent for advertising which enables us and our sponsors to provide advertising in the areas
                    mentioned (post, email, and telephone advertising). For this reason, the data are stored in
                    accordance with Article 6 1 b) GDPR and used by us for advertising purposes. The data are then also
                    passed on to the sponsors to provide advertising in the areas mentioned. If you terminate the
                    value-added services/information and multimedia contract, we will then refrain from continuing to
                    use these data for advertising purposes.<br>

                    If you conclude a value-added services/information and multimedia contract without obligation on
                    your part to grant consent for advertising, the above-mentioned use of the data for advertising
                    purposes will not apply.<br>

                    We also process your data on the basis of consent for advertising if you grant us this consent when
                    registering for the providing value-added services/information and multimedia services. In this
                    case, we use the data ourselves for advertising purposes and forward it to our sponsors within the
                    scope of the consent you granted.<br>

                    If you answer questions after/during registering for the value-added services/information and
                    multimedia services which do not refer to a specific product, we will store your answers with your
                    personal data to ensure targeted advertising. In the case of answers which do refer to a specific
                    product, we will forward your answer to the relevant company.<br>
                    Finally, we process your data to meet our fiscal and commercial accounting and record-keeping
                    obligations.
                </p>

                <h4>SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                <p>We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell or otherwise provide personal
                    information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services. We will retain
                    your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services
                    or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
                    agreements.<br>
                    We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law (e.g., to comply with
                    a subpoena, warrant, or court order) and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
                    rights, avoid litigation, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, and/or
                    respond to a government request. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that
                    such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of
                    public importance.<br>

                    We primarily send data to external service providers as we do not provide some services ourselves or
                    cannot sensibly provide them ourselves. We have external service providers that we use for all our
                    data processing and external service providers who only receive data if you specifically choose for
                    this data to be sent.<br>
                    Internal recipients and general external service providers Internally, all departments which need
                    the data for the above-mentioned purposes have access to your data:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data validation;</li>
                    <li>Newsletter sendings;</li>
                    <li>We also use external service providers to process the data for these purposes;</li>
                    <li>Date-hosting.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>DATA PROCESSING</h4>
                <p>Data that we only receive to provide value-added services/information and multimedia services will be
                    deleted no later than three months after the service has been completed. Value-added
                    services/information and multimedia are deemed to have been completed when you have stopped your
                    subscription by sending us relevant information via phone or e-mail.<br>
                    Long storage of this type is necessary as we still have to provide evidence that the promotional use
                    by us or our partners was legally admissible even after the consent has been revoked. If the consent
                    is revoked before the data have been used for advertising purposes, the data will be deleted within
                    a month of consent being revoked.
                </p>

                <h4>PERSON UNDER 18</h4>
                <p>
                    Our Service is not directed to individuals who are under the age of 18. The company does not
                    knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. If you have reason to believe
                    that an individual under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to the Company through the Service
                    please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
                </p>

                <h4>GDPR</h4>
                <p>
                    Your rights as registered and your revocation of consent. The General Data Protection Regulation
                    guarantees you certain rights that you can assert over us. You have the right:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To request confirmation from us as to whether personal data about you is being processed and, if
                        so, the specific circumstances of data processing (Article 15 GDPR: right of registration for
                        the
                        data subject);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately correct incorrect personal data about you In view of the purpose
                        of
                        the processing, you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data,
                        including through a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right of correction);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately delete personal data about you (Article 17 GDPR: the right of
                        deletion);</li>
                    <li>To request that we restrict processing (Article 18 GDPR: Right to restrict processing).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Finally, if you have given us your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
                    In this case, all data processing performed by us up to the time you revoke your consent is still
                    legal. Once you have revoked your consent, we will no longer use the information you have provided
                    for advertising purposes. We will also not
                    pass on your information to third parties for advertising purposes.
                </p>

                <h4>SECURITY</h4>
                <p>You use the Service at your own risk. We implement commercially reasonable technical,
                    administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Data both online and offline from
                    loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet
                    or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us
                    may not be secure.<br>
                    Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Service
                    or e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to the Company via the
                    Internet. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security
                    measures contained on the Service, or third-party websites.
                </p>
