			<h2 class="terms_title">TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h2>
			<div class="terms">
				<article>
					<p>
						The following is a legal agreement between you (you or User/s) and the content provider (we, us,
						or wapimo.com) of the site at https://wapimo.com (the Website) and all related websites,
						software, mobile apps, plug-ins, and other services that we provide (together, the Service).
						Your use of the Service, and our provision of the Service to you, constitutes an agreement by
						you and wapimo.com to be bound by the terms and conditions in these Terms.<br>
						We are not affiliated or connected with any of the brands associated with the prizes we offer as
						part of our competitions. Only active participants can be declared the winner of the prize draw.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h4>
					<p>To join the service you must pay the first weekly charge. Each week you will be presented with a
						quiz question either by SMS (text message) or via a link to our online Question Portal, and to
						be entered into the Prize-draw you must both provide the correct answer to the quiz question and
						successfully pay that week’s entry fee. The prize you have the chance of winning is clearly
						advertised on this site and will be confirmed in an SMS.<br>
						The winner is selected periodically, depending on the service and region, using a random
						selection process involving a complex computer algorithm without human intervention. This
						algorithm is a program that independently pools all eligible participants and selects a mobile
						number. The chosen mobile number is declared the winner and contacted by our customer care team
						to arrange prize delivery.<br>
						If you wish to opt out of receiving promotions you can email <b>support@wapimo.com</b> with the
						subject
						line opt-out of marketing to remove it from our marketing database. You may still see adverts
						for Wapimo services on websites and applications because such adverts are served by third-party
						ad servers in line with the commercial agreements in place between the third-party publishers
						and the ad network.

					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>REQUIREMENTS AND REGISTRATION</h4>
					<p>If you are under the age of 18 years, your entry will be rendered invalid and you will not be
						eligible to win the prize.<br>
						You will be charged a weekly cost by Premium Rate Text Message (PSMS) or Mobile Operator
						Billing. Both methods are regulated payment technologies. These charges will either appear on
						your monthly mobile phone bill or reduce your available credit if you are a pay-as-you-go
						customer. If you require further information on these official mobile payment technologies,
						please consult your mobile phone operator. Your mobile phone operator is not affiliated with the
						Wapimo service. For many reasons it is possible for charges to your mobile to occur after the
						end of a quiz period, for example, owing to but not restricted to network and technical
						issues.<br>
						Any claim will be subject to a full investigative including the analysis of the mobile phone
						users' interaction with a service, the service pages they have visited, the information they
						were presented and the interactions they took to join a service, including but not restricted to
						the receiving and sending of SMS messages.<br>
						In the event that any refund is awarded, by joining this service you accept that the maximum
						award will be equal to the charges incurred in the first week of the service. No other charges
						will be considered without exception. A maximum of one refund per mobile number will be awarded.
						In the case of joining multiple services or rejoining a service, one refund will be awarded per
						mobile number for one week only.<br>
						Eligible participants will be derived from those who have both answered the most relevant weekly
						question correctly and paid for the week’s entry.<br>
						The prize winner is selected at random using a sophisticated computer algorithm with no human
						intervention. If you’re a prize-winner you will either be telephoned by the Customer Care team
						or alerted by SMS (text message) to call in. Full contact details will be requested for prize
						delivery fulfillment. You can also receive a prize in monetary terms, the price in this case,
						will depend on your region or country. You can claim prizes awarded within 28 days following
						your notification.<br>
						By participating in the prize draw you are consenting to receive information, marketing, and
						offers from Wapimo, including but not restricted to post, email, text message, and telephone
						calls.
